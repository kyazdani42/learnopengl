# learnopengl

This repo holds the current state of my code for the magnificient [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com). \
Although the lessons are given for `c++`, i decided to use `rust` instead, using libraries like [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit), [glutin](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin) and [nalgebra_glm](https://docs.rs/nalgebra-glm).

## What i've learned so far

- Setup an opengl context
- Work with opengl objets and buffers
- Glsl: vertex and fragment shaders, uniforms
- Work with textures.
- Use a glm like library to create matrices for vertex transformations.
- Transform vertex through multiple matrices to display on the opengl view.
- Use euler angles to automate camera orientation.
- Use winit event loop to dispatch actions.
- Handle the display frame to draw when needed.
